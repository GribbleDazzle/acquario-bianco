## What is it?
This is a **Github repository** that will be used to share coding exercises and collaborate. 
Exploring features of **Git** and **Github** is also the goal of this project.

## Why this repository?
In the Data Science world Git and Github are some of the most used tools both in the open source and in the private sector. Github and Git enable the user to collaborate with others on a task, create a portfolio of personal projects and even create simple static websites!

Knowing how to use Git and Github will facilitate your journey as a data scientist and will make our coding sessions even more collaborative and interesting!

In order to grasp the powerfulness of Git and Github I will link a few informative sources that I consider quite useful.

## What is Git

but also easy to revert to a previous foot and merge it with your current leg."

While I was searching a proper way to formulate a simple definition of **Git** I found out that...you cannot define *Git* without using the word ***version control***. 

Now the problem is to define what a **version control** is, which is possibly an even more difficult task.

Every time I use a software like Microsoft Word to write something meaningful I find quite difficult to track all the changes that I do to the document.

I finish the first version and I save the document as *lavoro.docx* but then I find out that the wording of the first chapter is not brilliant. So I have to open it, modify the chapter, rename  and save it again. I want to keep the first version of the file, so I have to save both the versions: *lavoro.docx* and *lavoro_finale.docx*.

Now I have two copies of a slightly different document and the only way to have the history of all the changes is to keep all the versions...so I find myself overwhelmed by dozens of documents named progressively *lavoro_finale1.docx*, *lavoro_finalissimo.docx*, *lavoro_finale2.docx*, ect.

What a mess !!

That's why Git is indispensable: it enables me to keep all the changes that I've done to a document without bloating a folder with dozens of files. It is called ***version controlling*** because it saves all the versions of a file.

It is a powerful tool and the following links will explain better its properties and basic functions.

## What is Github

That's fairly easier to define: Github is a company that offers a **cloud-based Git repository**, meaning that you can save all the versions of a file not only on your local machine but also on the Cloud!!

Github has an intuitive interface and a lot of functions to save, share and collaborate on cooperative projects.

Here are a few references for a more complete explanation of what Github is and how to use it.

## Next steps

Now, what should you do in order to use Git and Github properly? I found this straightforward guide that will help you to start your journey with these tools.

Since Git can be used both from command line and from a GUI interface, I suggest you to find the best solution that fits **your** needs and **your** knowledge. In order to start using Github in a plug-and-play mode I suggest to try Github Desktop, an application that enables you to interact with Github using a GUI instead of the browser or the command line.

To set up your Github Desktop you can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/setting-up-github-desktop)

Pay attention that <u> in order to use Github Desktop you need to have already installed Git </u> (just like you need to have R installed in order to use Rstudio).

**To install Git in ...**

### Windows

If you are working within Windows environment don't worry, you simply need to install Git for Windows: [this guide](https://git-scm.com/download/win) will help you through the process.

Don't worry too much about the command line stuff you will see, Github Desktop will do that work for you.

### Mac OS

If you are working within a MacOS environment, be aware about the fact that Mac OS could have Git already installed. Just in case, follow the guide that you find [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

### Linux/Unix

If you are working within a Linux or Unix environment probably you already know how to install Git and maybe it's already installed in your machine. In any case, follow [this guide](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) in order to install Git in your specific linux distribution.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Once you are done with the Git installation you can easily customize and work in your Github Desktop installation, just follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/configuring-and-customizing-github-desktop/configuring-git-for-github-desktop)  to do a step-by-step installation and customization.


## Conclusion

I hope you understood the precious properties that Git and Github have and how you can benefit from knowing how to use them.

Our purpose for this repository is to share the best possible versions of the exercises we are doing, suggest changes to the scripts written by our colleagues and build a unique knowledge folder. I hope you'll see this as an opportunity for improving and for collaboration.

I welcome every suggestion about the management of the repository.
